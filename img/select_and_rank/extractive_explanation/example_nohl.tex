    \emph{What makes Bikram yoga unique is its focus on practicing yoga in a room heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit with 40 percent humidity. In Bikram yoga, be prepared to sweat profusely and come armed with a towel and lots of water. To practice Bikram at home, you'll need a space heater and access to the pose sequence. On a general basis, you need to hold the yoga poses for about 10-12 breaths. With practice, you can also go up to 30 breaths. We chatted for a few moments, and found that we came to completely different conclusions. She finds Bikram more difficult because of the intense heat (about 5-10 degrees hotter than a hot vinyasa class) and lack of breaks in the standing series. That is why Bikram is easier for me. It will help you hold the pose for around 3 minutes. It is best to count the time in breaths (one breath cycle is one deep inhalation followed by complete exhalation).} \\
